Make tag search work on camera tags
 -> refactor search filter/Q object construction
	- negation broken
	 (check SVN?  Is it even possible with current?)

XXX flaw in search by camera: camera nickname is per-user, but may do
global search without user qualification...

Add proper parser for date expressions, rather than rely on regexp
	- add calendar computations (+1w, etc)

Make clickable tag links in picture descriptions add additional terms to current search

Add opensearch links/description

Sort out timezones
	- camera timezone
		= may be fixed or variable
	- cameratag timezone?
		= timezone of camera in a daterange
		= cameratags range always UTC
	- picture timezone
		= timestamp correction = camera timezone - location timezone
		= timezone of camera location
		= derived from geotag?
		= try to compute if NULL, otherwise explicitly set
	- user timezone
	- display timezone
		= local time of object

UI
	- separate imagestore/ui namespace (and packages)
	- YUI?
	- timeline
		- dynamic hot zones?
	- how much non-JS support?
		- no interaction
		- incremental lists?

Tags
	- editing

XXX Really want a query/resource for "all cameratags for this set of
pics".  Maybe just include it as part of the pic data?  Need only be
in format=timeline.  Or just get the client to do it?

django.core.urlresolvers.resolve does URL->object mapping
XXX how to deal with recursion?  Allocate new instances of the view
objects?  Make them factories?  How does that interact with
@permalink?
